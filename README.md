# Pricing Panel
This is my first project submission for the Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele. It is a 3-tier pricing panel. The panel's design was created by [Travis Williamson](https://codepen.io/travisw/pen/EvbKwd?editors=0010).

## Take 1
This project boosted my confidence in my flair for HTML and CSS. Fairly simple, but I still treated it as a challenge, and I think I did well.

## Take 2
My finished project looked similar to Colt's solution, even though we didn't write the exact code. There's more than one way to tackle a challenge...
